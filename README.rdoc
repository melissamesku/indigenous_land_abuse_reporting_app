==Land Defense web app

I designed and built Land Defense using Ruby on Rails with a SQL database. 

The app is intended for use by indigenous groups and supporting organizations to report on land rights abuses on indigenous territory. The database has been seeded with sample content drawn from contemporary news stories about land rights violations in Amazonia and rainforests in Indonesia. 

Land Defense is deployed on Heroku (https://sleepy-depths-8976.herokuapp.com).
