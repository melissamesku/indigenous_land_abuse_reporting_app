#LandDefense web app

I designed and built LandDefense using Ruby on Rails with a SQL database. 

The app is intended for use by indigenous groups and supporting organizations to report on land rights abuses on indigenous territory. 

LandDefense is deployed on Heroku (https://sleepy-depths-8976.herokuapp.com).
