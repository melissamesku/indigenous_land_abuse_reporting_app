  headline: "New wave of illegal gold miners dumping mercury in Yanomami rivers", 
  details: "Illegal gold mining has been happening in the Yanomami's homeland, the Alto Orinoco – Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve, Venezuela, since the 1970s. But a new wave of illegal gold miners is swarming the area bringing with them malaria and other disease, and dumping mercury in the rivers. Additionally there are uncontacted tribes in the forest who are at particular risk as they live close to where the miners are intruding.",

  details: "Illegal loggers in the Aribola region of the Brazilian Amazon have set areas of this protected forest on fire in retaliation for the Guajajara's attempts to protect their land. Thirty indigenous firefighters have been combatting the flames while the government has failed to provide assistance. In under two months, 45% of Guajajara-held lands have burned. \n UPDATE: Local government has sent firefighters to help put out the blaze. The firefighters have been attacked by illegal loggers and the situation has escalated and now has limited international news coverage.",
