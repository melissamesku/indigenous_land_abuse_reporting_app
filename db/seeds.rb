  details: "Illegal gold mining has been happening in the Yanomami's homeland, the Alto Orinoco – Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve, Venezuela, since the 1970s. But a new wave of illegal gold miners is swarming the area bringing with them malaria and other disease, and dumping mercury in the rivers. Additionally there are uncontacted tribes in the forest who are at particular risk as they live close to where the miners are intruding.",

  headline: "5000 Hectares stolen to grow palm oil illegally", 
  details: "Activist leader Washington Bolivar said, 'Our lands have been devastated, all the forest is gone, and the streams are completely churned up and blocked, there is now only one stream we can still use for clean drinking water.' In just three years, over 5200 hectares of ancestral forest has been destroyed. The Peruvian government has failed to fully recognize the community's rightful claim to their land. The government sold the parcel of land to Plantaciones de Pucallpa in 2012, though it wass technically illegal to do so, given that all conversion of primary forest, which is about 80% of that area, is expressly forbidden by law.",
